It's comforting to know that their influence still guides us. Last Friday, my partner and I talked about how our loved ones have influenced us and what their values meant to us. It was an emotional chat, but it made us feel closer and showed us what really matters. \n[2023-08-26 17:34:00] Deborah: Those types of conversations really help build relationships.

Have you ever considered incorporating those values into your work as well?\n[2023-08-26 17:35:30] Jolene: Yeah, Deborah! We've been figuring out how to add these values into our projects. As an engineering student, I want to use my talents to do good and help solve important problems. I'm keen on coming up with new ideas and making things more efficient to make the world a better place. Going further, my mom stressed the value of helping others and that's something I want to keep in mind for my engineering projects.\n[2023-08-26 17:36:00] Deborah: When our work ties into our values, it becomes more meaningful. What goals or ideas do you have for incorporating those values into your future projects?\n[2023-08-26 17:36:30] Jolene: In the future, I'm aiming to work on projects that make a real difference to communities. I'm interested in sustainable initiatives and developing innovative solutions for environmental issues. I also want to get involved with organizations that focus on social causes, using my skills to help out. It's about connecting my passion for engineering with my commitment to making a positive impact.\n[2023-08-26 17:37:00] Deborah: You've got a lot of amazing plans for the future. Which projects are you most interested in getting involved in?\n[2023-08-26 17:37:30] Jolene: I'm keen on two projects in particular. One is focused on developing renewable energy, like solar, to help communities and reduce dependence on non-renewables. \n[2023-08-26 17:38:00] Deborah: Wow Jolene, that's really inspiring!\n[2023-08-26 17:38:30] Jolene: The other is finding ways to supply clean water to those with limited access.

Last Tuesday, my gf, Toby, and I had a really awesome night playing board games. It was really nice. What's been up with you lately?\n[2023-10-13 16:22:30] Audrey: [Audrey shared an image: a photo of a pan of cookies on a wooden table] Hey! Sounds like you've been busy!

Joanna described experiencing a complex mix of emotions, including relief, anxiety, excitement, and terror about the possibility of her work being noticed and adapted for the big screen. Nate responded promptly, congratulating Joanna on finishing her second script and encouraging her by affirming that her hard work and dedication would be recognized. He also hoped Joanna had found time to relax after her efforts. Joanna acknowledged the difficulty of decompressing, explaining that she felt caught between hope and doubt. At 7:00:30 PM UTC, Nate shared a photograph of two tortoises lying on the ground in a jungle, using the image to remind Joanna to appreciate small moments despite doubts. Joanna found the picture adorable and asked about Nate's choice to keep tortoises as pets. Nate replied at 7:01:30 PM UTC with another photo showing three turtles sitting on rocks in a pond, explaining his attraction to turtles due to their uniqueness, slow pace, low-maintenance care, and calming presence. Joanna commented on how peaceful the turtles appeared and inquired about the difficulty of caring for them. Nate explained that proper care involved keeping their environment clean, feeding them well, and ensuring sufficient light, describing the experience as enjoyable. Joanna expressed that having pets must be wonderful, to which Nate agreed, emphasizing the joy and relaxation pets bring.

Joanna described the experience as nerve-wracking but inspiring to see her words come alive. Nate congratulated Joanna and acknowledged the mix of fear and excitement she must have felt, expressing admiration for her inspiration. Nate then shifted the conversation to a detail he had noticed during their last meeting: a Spider-Man pin on Joanna's purse. He asked if Spider-Man was her favorite superhero or if she had another favorite. Joanna confirmed Spider-Man as a longtime favorite, appreciating Peter Parker's struggles balancing heroism and personal life, but she also expressed fondness for all superheroes, valuing their unique stories and powers. She then asked Nate about his favorite superhero. Nate responded by sharing a photo of a toy Iron Man figure standing on a white surface and explained that Iron Man was his top pick because of the character's technology and sarcastic humor, which made him feel invincible.

Are there any outdoor activities you enjoy lately?\n[2023-08-04 11:10:00] Andrew: Well for me hiking is the best. Being out in nature with all the trees and fresh air always refreshes me.

Sharing something you enjoy with someone is great. Plus, those types of bonds bring loads of joy and love.\n[2023-08-04 11:12:30] Audrey: [Audrey shared an image: a photo of a dog laying in a dog bed in a living room] Yeah, humans and animals have a cool connection.

They're my companions and always make my day better.\n[2023-08-04 11:13:00] Andrew: They're pretty lucky to have you as their owner.

Do you have any advice for city-dwellers that owns a pup?\n[2023-08-04 11:16:30] Audrey: My advice would be to make sure you have enough time and energy for a pup - they need lots of attention and walks! Especially for a German Shepherd like Toby, he'll need to offset a lot of energy.\n[2023-08-04 11:17:00] Andrew: Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely keep that in mind. I want to make sure I'm not limiting Toby's growth but not taking him out not enough.\n[2023-08-04 11:17:30] Audrey: No worries, Andrew!

Remembering those we love is important.\n[2023-08-26 17:33:30] Jolene: I understand, Deb. Remembering and cherishing the memories of our loved ones is so important. It's comforting to know that their influence still guides us. Last Friday, my partner and I talked about how our loved ones have influenced us and what their values meant to us. It was an emotional chat, but it made us feel closer and showed us what really matters. \n[2023-08-26 17:34:00] Deborah: Those types of conversations really help build relationships. Can you tell me more about the values they have given you?\n[2023-08-26 17:34:30] Jolene: Definitely! Our loved ones have taught us to persevere and stay resilient, like my mom always said to never give up, and my partner's dad showed them to stay determined. Their values have influenced us to pursue our goals, such as me with engineering and my partner with their creative endeavors. Even though they're not here, we both feel their values encouraging us along our paths.\n[2023-08-26 17:35:00] Deborah: That's wonderful to hear, Jolene! It's amazing how their values continue to guide you, even in their absence. It sounds like you and your partner are honoring their memory by pursuing your respective passions. Have you ever considered incorporating those values into your work as well?\n[2023-08-26 17:35:30] Jolene: Yeah, Deborah! We've been figuring out how to add these values into our projects. As an engineering student, I want to use my talents to do good and help solve important problems. I'm keen on coming up with new ideas and making things more efficient to make the world a better place. Going further, my mom stressed the value of helping others and that's something I want to keep in mind for my engineering projects.\n[2023-08-26 17:36:00] Deborah: When our work ties into our values, it becomes more meaningful. What goals or ideas do you have for incorporating those values into your future projects?\n[2023-08-26 17:36:30] Jolene: In the future, I'm aiming to work on projects that make a real difference to communities. I'm interested in sustainable initiatives and developing innovative solutions for environmental issues. I also want to get involved with organizations that focus on social causes, using my skills to help out. It's about connecting my passion for engineering with my commitment to making a positive impact.\n[2023-08-26 17:37:00] Deborah: You've got a lot of amazing plans for the future. Which projects are you most interested in getting involved in?\n[2023-08-26 17:37:30] Jolene: I'm keen on two projects in particular. One is focused on developing renewable energy, like solar, to help communities and reduce dependence on non-renewables. \n[2023-08-26 17:38:00] Deborah: Wow Jolene, that's really inspiring!\n[2023-08-26 17:38:30] Jolene: The other is finding ways to supply clean water to those with limited access.

Maria conveyed that coping with the loss had been very difficult but she was trying to stay positive. John responded with sympathy, sharing a photo of his family sitting on the grass with a baby, and offered his support to Maria. He mentioned that he was doing well and had recently enjoyed a picnic with his wife and children. Maria thanked John for his support and inquired about his family, commenting on the baby in the photo and asking for the child's name. John replied that his family was doing great and introduced the one-year-old baby as Kyle. Maria asked John about his parenting experience, to which John responded by sharing another photo of two children playing on playground equipment. He described parenting as a wild ride with ups and downs but emphasized that the love and happiness outweighed the challenges. Maria acknowledged the difficulties and rewards of parenting and asked if John took his children to the park often. John shared a third photo showing a young girl and boy on a swing, explaining that they visited the park several times a week for family bonding and to let the kids play freely. He recounted a recent enjoyable weekend where the children experienced carefree joy. Maria commented that it looked like a blast and was glad everyone got a chance to try the swings. John confirmed that everyone had fun swinging and noted that he enjoyed planning activities for his family. Maria expressed admiration and asked how John came up with his activity ideas. John explained that he sought out fun experiences such as walks, picnics, or local events, mentioning a violin concert they had attended the previous week (February 27 - March 5, 2023). Maria shared an image of a shadow box containing a picture of a castle and reflected on how making memories with siblings during her youth had lasting value. John complimented the picture, describing it as storybook-like, and asked about the inspiration behind it.
